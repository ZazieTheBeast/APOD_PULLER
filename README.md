# APOD_PULLER

This is a little program that will download the Astonomy Picture of the Day from NASA.gov and apply it to the background.
Intended to be set up as a daily job, it will not overwrite existing images if pulled from the same day, it will keep them 
though... So after awhile you may want to clean the folder created out.

Currently only works in Windows.

Coming soon.. LXDE (raspiban), Ubuntu... OSX? Android?
